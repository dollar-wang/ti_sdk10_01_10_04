# Configuration file for fw_(printenv/setenv) utility.
# Up to two entries are valid, in this case the redundant
# environment sector is assumed present.
# Notice, that the "Number of sectors" is ignored on NOR and SPI-dataflash.
# Furthermore, if the Flash sector size is omitted, this value is assumed to
# be the same as the Environment size, which is valid for NOR and SPI-dataflash

# NOR example
# MTD device name	Device offset	Env. size	Flash sector size	Number of sectors
#/dev/mtd1		0x0000		0x20000		0x20000
#/dev/mtd2		0x0000		0x4000		0x4000

# MTD SPI-dataflash example
# EMMC device name   Device offset   Env. size   EMMC sector size
/dev/mmcblk0         0x400000        0x2000      0x200
/dev/mmcblk0         0x402000        0x2000      0x200
